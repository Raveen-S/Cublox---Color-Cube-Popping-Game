# Cublox---Color-Cube-Popping-Game
Cublox is a fast-paced, arcade-style game inspired by Fruit Ninja, but with a twist: instead of slicing fruits, you pop colorful cubes! Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Cublox tests your speed and reflexes as you hover your mouse to pop cubes before they fall.


ðŸŽ® Features:

Colorful Cubes: Cubes of different colors appear on the screen, and your goal is to pop them by hovering over them with the mouse.

Health System: Each missed cube reduces your health. When your health reaches zero, itâ€™s game over.

Score Challenge: Keep popping cubes to achieve the highest score and challenge your friends to beat it!

Progressive Difficulty: As the game progresses, the cubes appear faster, increasing the challenge.

Responsive Design: Playable on both desktop and mobile devices.


ðŸ›  Technologies Used:

HTML5: Structure for the game interface.

CSS3: Styling for the game elements and layout.

JavaScript (ES6): Handles game logic, health system, scoring, and cube popping functionality.
